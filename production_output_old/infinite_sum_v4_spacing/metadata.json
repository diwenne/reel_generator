Then fill half of the remaining bottom right (bottom right). Continue this spiral pattern to show it fills the square. Use .next_to and .align_to exclusively. CRITICAL: ALL LABELS MUST BE OUTSIDE THE SHAPES, NOT ON TOP OF THEM. Put labels beside or below shapes with buff=0.3. Title must have large gap from content.",
