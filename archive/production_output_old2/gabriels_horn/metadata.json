  "description": "Gabriels Horn paradox - infinite surface area but finite volume. Title 'Infinite Surface, Finite Volume?' starts CENTER then animates UP. Use Text() not MathTex. Step 1: Show the curve y = 1/x from x=1 to x=5. Step 2: Rotate this curve around x-axis to create a 3D horn shape (show as 2D cross section). Step 3: Show that as horn extends to infinity, VOLUME converges to \u03c0. Step 4: But SURFACE AREA grows to infinity. Step 5: Paradox: You can FILL it with a finite amount of paint, but you can NEVER paint the inside. Show Volume = \u03c0 in GREEN, Surface = \u221e in RED. Final: 'V = \u03c0, S = \u221e' in yellow centered.",
