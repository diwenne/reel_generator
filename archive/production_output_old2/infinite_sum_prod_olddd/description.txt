Cataclysm is a renowned custom level in Geometry Dash, originally created and verified by the player Ggb0y. It is classified as an Extreme Demon, representing one of the highest tiers of difficulty within the game. The level is characterized by its distinct red and black "hell" theme, featuring very tight flying and wave sections that demand precise timing.

Historically, this level is significant as it helped establish the standard for the modern Extreme Demon difficulty. It serves as the first installment of the "Apocalyptic Trilogy," which also includes the levels Bloodbath and Aftermath. Completing Cataclysm 100% with all three coins is widely regarded as a major milestone for competitive players in the community.
