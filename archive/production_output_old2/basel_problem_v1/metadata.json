  "description": "Prove the famous Basel Problem: 1/1\u00b2 + 1/2\u00b2 + 1/3\u00b2 + 1/4\u00b2 + ... = \u03c0\u00b2/6. This stunning result was solved by Euler in 1734. Start by showing the infinite sum \u2211(1/n\u00b2) from n=1 to infinity. Show the first few terms: 1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + ... and their partial sums converging. Then reveal the shocking answer: this equals \u03c0\u00b2/6 \u2248 1.6449. Display the beautiful final equation with a box around it. Add text explaining this connects an infinite sum of rationals to the transcendental number \u03c0\u00b2. Use elegant typography for the mathematical expressions.",
