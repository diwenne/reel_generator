Cataclysm is a renowned Extreme Demon level in Geometry Dash, originally created and published by Ggb0y. It is historically significant for establishing the "hell" style, characterized by a distinct red and black color scheme that influenced many future top-tier levels. The gameplay involves tight spaces, fast-paced wave sections, and complex obstacles that demand high precision.

For many players, beating Cataclysm serves as a major gateway into the tier of Extreme Demons. While it has been surpassed in difficulty over the years, it remains a classic test of skill and consistency. Achieving 100% completion, especially with all three coins, stands as a notable accomplishment in the game's competitive scene.
