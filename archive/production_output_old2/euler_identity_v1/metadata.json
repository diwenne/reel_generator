Show the equation building piece by piece: first e in blue, then i in green, then pi in red, then the equals sign, then -1 in yellow. Explain briefly with text: e is 2.718, i is sqrt of -1, pi is 3.14159. Show how these 3 constants combine to equal exactly -1. Final reveal: e^(i\u03c0) + 1 = 0 in large yellow centered - the complete Euler identity.",
