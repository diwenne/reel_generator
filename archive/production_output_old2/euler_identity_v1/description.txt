Geometry Dash is a rhythm-based platformer developed by RobTop Games. The player controls a geometric icon that moves automatically across the screen. The primary objective is to navigate through various levels filled with hazards, such as spikes and walls, without crashing.

The gameplay relies heavily on precise timing and pattern recognition. Players must jump, fly, and flip in synchronization with the background music to survive. If the icon hits an obstacle, the level restarts from the beginning immediately, requiring consistent focus and practice to complete the more difficult stages.
