Step 1: Show y = 1/x using a PROPER FRACTION with VGroup - Text('1') on top, horizontal Line in middle, Text('x') on bottom, arranged with .arrange(DOWN, buff=0.1). Show 'y =' next to the fraction. Step 2: Draw the curve from x=1 extending right toward infinity. Step 3: Rotating creates horn shape (show as silhouette). Step 4: VOLUME = \u03c0 shown in GREEN. Step 5: SURFACE = \u221e shown in RED. Paradox: Fill with finite paint but can never paint inside. Final: 'V = \u03c0, S = \u221e' yellow centered.",
