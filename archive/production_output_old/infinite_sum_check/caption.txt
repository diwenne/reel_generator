**Infinite Sum = Mind BLOWN!** 🤯

Ever wondered if you could add infinitely many numbers and get a finite result? Check out this visual proof that 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... actually equals 1! We're using a square to perfectly illustrate how each fraction fills up the remaining space until it’s completely covered.

The heart-pounding gameplay you see in the background is none other than "Cataclysm" by Ggb0y, an Extreme Demon level in Geometry Dash. Released in 2013, created and verified by Ggb0y, "Cataclysm" quickly cemented itself as one of the most notoriously difficult levels of its time. Before the introduction of new mechanics in later updates, "Cataclysm" was famous for its fast-paced gameplay, tight timings, and intricate design, pushing the limits of player skill and device performance. For years, beating "Cataclysm" was seen as a monumental achievement, a testament to dedication and mastery of the game. Even today, it remains a revered and iconic level, standing as a symbol of Geometry Dash's early extreme difficulty scene and inspiring countless players to test their limits.
