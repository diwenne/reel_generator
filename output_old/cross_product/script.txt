Cross Product. The cross product of two 3D vectors is perpendicular to both; its length equals the spanned area, and its direction follows the right-hand rule. Example: a in blue and b in green. The yellow shape shows the area; the red arrow is a × b, pointing out. Curl your right hand from a to b; your thumb gives a × b. Takeaway: it encodes area and orientation, and is zero when vectors are parallel.
