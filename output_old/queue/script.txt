Queue! The easiest data structure to picture.

Here’s the hook. It’s like a line at a coffee shop.
First in. First out.
No cutting.

Core idea: you add to the back. That’s ENQUEUE.
You remove from the front. That’s DEQUEUE.

Quick example.
We enqueue A, then B, then C.
Now the front is A.
So when we dequeue, A leaves first.
Then B.

Takeaway: Queues are FIFO.
Perfect for tasks, printers, and messages.
