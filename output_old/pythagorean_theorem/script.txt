Pythagorean Theorem. Visual proof by rearranging areas. Take a right triangle with legs a and b and hypotenuse c. Build a big square of side a plus b. Arrange four copies of the triangle against the sides; the central hole is a square of area c². Now slide the same four triangles to the corners; what remains are two squares of areas a² and b². Both layouts fill the same big square, so c² equals a² + b².
