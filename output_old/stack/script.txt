Stack!
Picture a stack of plates... you always touch the top.
Two moves: push and pop.
Push adds to the top. Pop removes the top.
One rule: last in... first out.
We’ve got A, B, C. Watch this...
Push D on top...
Now pop... D comes off.
Top shifts back to C.
Need undo, back buttons, recursion? Use a stack.
LIFO. Simple.
